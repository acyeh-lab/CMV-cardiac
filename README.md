# CMV / Cardiac ultrasound project

## Hypothesis:
- CMV reactivation leads to increased cardiac risk in the post-stem cell transplant setting.

## Data:
- We have retrospective clinical data derived from Eric Chow's CV survey cohort that shows that the risk of cardiovascular outcomes (MI, stroke, CHF) is significantly increased with exposure to CMV as seen in prior evidence of CMV reactivation.
