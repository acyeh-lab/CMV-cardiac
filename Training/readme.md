# Vevo F2 and Vevo 2100 Ultrasound Training

## 1. Basic Equipment Training

**Who should do this:**  
Any new users or those who want a refresher should complete our basic equipment training.

**Steps:**
- [Online Hutch Learning – Vevo F2 Ultrasound Training](https://hutchlearning.org)  
  *Note: This training is mainly for the BSL-1 ultrasound located in Weintraub, but the principles are the same for the older 2100 unit in BSL-2 at the Steam Plant.*

- Equipment orientation with me  
  *Note: I will be out of town starting tomorrow for a conference most of this week, but we can look at next week for scheduling!*

## 2. Cardiac Training

To get the most out of this, I recommend the following **three-step approach**:

### a. Online Cardiac Training Material from Vendor

- Start with the online material from the vendor  
  *You and Tanvi should already have access.*
- Watch the training videos again and share with anyone planning to learn this.
- I will resend the login information via email.

**System Serial Number (may be required):** `2100-0317`

### b. Practice Cardiac Measurements (In-house)

- I can help you get some practice with cardiac measurements.
- I've attended several cardiac training sessions and performed intracardiac injections.
- Our internal training is likely more cost-effective than vendor training.  
  **Internal rate:** `$62/hr`

### c. Vendor Training

- If you’d like more formal training, we can request another session from the vendor.
- They have done this for us before.
- A fee may apply (I can inquire about the cost).
